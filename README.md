# Multiplayer Trivia Game

Multiplayer Trivia Game is a Java-based, real-time, and multi-player trivia quiz game based on socket-based client-server. The server creates trivia sessions that players can join and answer questions, competing for high scores on a dynamically updated leaderboard. Questions are divided into three categories: easy, medium, and hard, which will increase if a player reaches a certain score. A possible example of the score needed could be 30 and 60 points which keeps the game challenging but alluring. The leaderboard maintains the highest scores of players and is only updated when players are outdone by them, even if the players replay. Real-time notification when players enter or leave the game. Multi-client handling of the server through multithreading ensures that the communication runs smoothly and the quiz experience is fun for the participants.
